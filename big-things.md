# Big Things

## What is greater, the number of atoms that can fit into the observable universe, or possible GUID/UUIDs

Let's compare these two enormous numbers

**Number of atoms in the observable universe:**
This is estimated to be around 10^80 atoms (a 1 followed by 80 zeros).

**Number of possible GUIDs/UUIDs:**
A standard UUID (version 4) has 122 bits of randomness (out of 128 total bits, with 6 bits reserved for version and variant information). This gives us 2^122 possible UUIDs, which equals approximately 5.3 × 10^36 possible values.

Wait, that seems wrong - let me recalculate. Actually, the total number of possible 128-bit UUIDs (including all versions) is 2^128 = 3.4 × 10^38.

**The winner: Atoms in the observable universe by an enormous margin!**

10^80 is incomprehensibly larger than 10^38. To put this in perspective:
- 10^80 ÷ 10^38 = 10^42

This means you could assign a unique UUID to every atom in the universe and still need 10^42 times more UUIDs than actually exist. In fact, you could give every atom in the universe a trillion trillion trillion unique UUIDs and still have plenty of atoms left over without IDs.

While UUIDs are designed to be practically unique for computing purposes (the chance of collision is negligible for any realistic use case), the physical universe contains vastly more atoms than there are possible UUIDs.

## What can compete with randomness vs the atoms in the observable universe

Let's compare the number of grains of sand in the Sahara Desert to both UUIDs and atoms in the observable universe.

**Grains of sand in the Sahara Desert:**
The Sahara covers about 9 million km². Estimates vary widely, but a commonly cited approximation is around 10^18 to 10^21 grains of sand. Let's use 10^20 as a reasonable middle estimate.

**Comparing all three:**
- Possible UUIDs: ~10^38
- Grains of sand in Sahara: ~10^20
- Atoms in observable universe: ~10^80

**The ranking from smallest to largest:**
1. Grains of sand in Sahara: 10^20
2. Possible UUIDs: 10^38
3. Atoms in universe: 10^80

So UUIDs win against the Sahara's sand grains by a huge margin - there are about 10^18 (a quintillion) times more possible UUIDs than grains of sand in the Sahara.

To visualize this: you could assign every single grain of sand in the Sahara its own unique UUID, and you'd only use an infinitesimally small fraction (1/10^18) of all possible UUIDs. You could do this for a quintillion different Sahara deserts and still have virtually all your UUIDs unused.

But atoms in the universe still dwarf everything else - there are 10^42 times more atoms than possible UUIDs, and 10^60 times more atoms than Sahara sand grains!

## What else in computer science could compete with randomness vs the atoms in the observable universe

Let's explore computer science constructs that could compete with the 10^80 atoms in the observable universe.

**Strong contenders that actually beat atoms:**

**SHA-256 hashes:** 2^256 ≈ 10^77 possible values - very close but still falls short by about 1000x

**SHA-512 hashes:** 2^512 ≈ 10^154 possible values - this crushes the atom count by 10^74 times!

**RSA-2048 keys:** The keyspace is approximately 2^2048 ≈ 10^617 - absolutely dwarfs atoms

**AES-256 keys:** 2^256 ≈ 10^77 - similar to SHA-256, close but not quite

**IPv6 address space:** 2^128 ≈ 10^38 - not even close

**Bitcoin's private key space:** 2^256 ≈ 10^77 - again, close but falls short

**More exotic comparisons:**

**All possible chess games:** Estimated at 10^120 (Shannon number) - this beats atoms by 10^40!

**All possible Go games:** Approximately 10^360 - absolutely astronomical

**All possible states of a 1TB hard drive:** 2^(8×10^12) ≈ 10^(2.4×10^12) - incomprehensibly larger

**All possible 1-megapixel images:** With 24-bit color, that's 2^(10^6 × 24) ≈ 10^(7.2×10^6) possible images

**The pattern:** Once you get into cryptographic hash functions with 256+ bits, large key spaces, or combinatorial explosions in games/data, you start matching or exceeding atomic scales. The really mind-bending ones involve all possible states of storage media or all possible digital content of a certain size - these make even the number of atoms look trivial.

The fascinating thing is that while we can mathematically define these enormous spaces, we could never actually enumerate or use most of them even if we had the entire universe as a computer!


## Deck of cards possible combinations when shuffled


The number of possible arrangements of a standard 52-card deck is absolutely mind-blowing.

**Number of possible deck shuffles:**
52! (52 factorial) = 52 × 51 × 50 × ... × 2 × 1 ≈ 8 × 10^67

**Comparing to our other numbers:**
- Deck shuffles: ~10^68
- Atoms in universe: ~10^80
- Possible UUIDs: ~10^38
- Sahara sand grains: ~10^20

So a shuffled deck has fewer possible arrangements than atoms in the universe, but only by a factor of about 10^12 (a trillion). It's remarkably close on a cosmic scale!

**The mind-blowing fact about shuffled decks:**
Every time you properly shuffle a deck, you're almost certainly creating an arrangement that has never existed before in the history of the universe and will never exist again. 

To put this in perspective:
- If every star in the observable universe (about 10^24 stars) had a billion planets
- And each planet had a billion people
- And each person shuffled a deck of cards every second
- For the entire age of the universe (about 14 billion years)
- They would have produced about 10^50 different shuffles
- That's still only 0.0000000000000001% of all possible arrangements!

The number of possible deck arrangements is so large that it's effectively infinite for all practical purposes. It's one of those everyday objects that contains more complexity than we can truly comprehend.

## Cryptography and randomness, ways humans can try and understand it


**The "Time" Perspective:**

**Cracking modern encryption by brute force:**
If you could check one AES-256 key every nanosecond (billion per second), it would take 10^60 years to check them all. The universe is only 10^10 years old. You'd need 10^50 universe lifetimes!

**UUID collision birthday paradox:**
You'd need to generate about 10^19 UUIDs (10 quintillion) before having a 50% chance of a collision. At 1 million UUIDs per second, that's 317,000 years of generation.

**Bitcoin private keys:**
If you turned the entire Earth into a computer that could check a trillion trillion keys per second, the sun would die before you'd check even 0.000...001% of Bitcoin's keyspace.

**Physical Comparisons That Break Your Brain:**

**Password entropy visualization:**
- An 8-character password (lowercase only): 26^8 ≈ 2×10^11 possibilities - about the number of stars in our galaxy
- Add uppercase: 52^8 ≈ 5×10^13 - number of cells in human body  
- Add numbers and symbols: 94^8 ≈ 6×10^15 - grains of sand on all Earth's beaches
- Make it 16 characters: 94^16 ≈ 3×10^31 - more than all bacteria that have ever lived

**The "Monkeys with Typewriters" Update:**
The classic infinite monkeys theorem, modernized: If every atom in the universe was a computer generating random 256-bit numbers since the Big Bang, they still wouldn't have generated duplicate SHA-256 hashes.

**Thermodynamic Limits - Landauer's Principle:**
There's a minimum energy required to flip a bit (about 3×10^-21 joules at room temperature). To merely count through all 256-bit numbers would require more energy than our sun will produce in its entire lifetime. To count through 2048-bit RSA keys would require the energy output of 10^500 suns!

**The "Dealing Yourself Royal Flushes" Metric:**
The odds of shuffling a deck into perfect order (A-K of spades, then hearts, diamonds, clubs) is 1 in 52! 
This is equivalent to:
- Winning the Powerball lottery 9 times in a row
- Flipping a coin and getting heads 226 times in a row
- Randomly selecting a specific atom from all atoms in a trillion galaxies

**Information Theory Mind-Benders:**

**Digital Pigeon Principle:**
Every possible 1GB file already "exists" mathematically - there are "only" 2^(8 billion) of them. Among those files are:
- Every movie that will ever be made
- Every book in every language (including ones not yet invented)
- Every photo of every moment that could ever be photographed
- Perfect predictions of tomorrow's stock prices
- The cure for cancer (if expressible in 1GB)

The problem? Finding the right one among the 10^2,400,000,000 possibilities!

**Kolmogorov Complexity Paradox:**
Most random numbers can't be compressed or described in fewer bits than the number itself. This means most 256-bit numbers literally cannot be communicated more efficiently than just stating all 256 bits - they have no pattern, no shortcut, no simpler description.

**The "Simulation" Angle:**
If our universe is a simulation, it might run on ~10^120 bits of information (based on the Bekenstein bound for the observable universe). A single modern cryptographic operation like RSA-4096 uses keyspaces that would require multiple universes worth of information just to enumerate.

**Practical Randomness We Can Feel:**

**Spotify's Shuffle Problem:**
True randomness feels wrong to humans. If Spotify played songs truly randomly, you'd occasionally get the same song 3 times in a row (birthday paradox). They had to make their shuffle "less random" to feel "more random" to us.

**The Lottery Paradox:**
The numbers 1-2-3-4-5-6 are exactly as likely as any other lottery combination, but our brains refuse to believe it. Every lottery draw is literally a 1-in-14-million miracle happening before our eyes.

**Your Personal Entropy:**
Your exact sequence of:
- GPS coordinates throughout your life
- Heartbeat timing variations
- Exact words you've spoken
Creates a unique entropy signature that could never be replicated. You are, mathematically speaking, a one-time pad the universe will never reproduce.

These numbers reveal something profound: the gap between what we can define mathematically and what can physically exist is staggering. We've created mathematical spaces so large that the physical universe itself becomes a rounding error!

Here are more mind-bending ways to understand cryptographic and computational enormity!

**The "Destruction of Information" Perspective:**

**The Black Hole Computer:**
To store all possible 512-bit hashes, you'd need a black hole with a radius of about 10^60 meters. Our entire observable universe has a radius of "only" 10^26 meters. The information storage would create a black hole that swallows multiple universes!

**Maxwell's Demon Gets Tired:**
At the theoretical limit of computation (Bremermann's limit), a computer the mass of Earth could perform at most 10^75 operations in the age of the universe. This means Earth literally cannot count to 2^256 before the universe ends - it's not just impractical, it's physically forbidden by the laws of computation.

**Reversible Computing Paradox:**
To check all possible Bitcoin private keys without generating heat (using reversible computing), you'd still need to store the result somewhere. The information alone would have mass - enough mass to create a black hole larger than our galaxy!

**Biological and Evolution Comparisons:**

**DNA Keyspace:**
Human DNA has about 3 billion base pairs. The number of possible human genomes (4^3,000,000,000) is about 10^1,800,000,000. This makes SHA-512 look like a joke, but most combinations would be non-viable. Still, the number of "valid" possible humans exceeds atoms in the universe by an insane margin.

**Protein Folding Combinations:**
A modest protein of 100 amino acids has 20^100 ≈ 10^130 possible sequences. The universe hasn't had enough time to try even a tiny fraction of possible proteins. Life has explored basically 0% of available biochemistry!

**Neural Combinations:**
Your brain has ~86 billion neurons. The number of possible connection patterns is approximately 2^(7.5 trillion) - more states than atoms in 10^trillion universes. Your brain's current state has likely never existed before in any brain ever.

**The "Speed of Light" Reality Check:**

**The Diameter Problem:**
If you built a computer the size of the solar system to crack encryption, signals couldn't travel across it fast enough. At light speed, it takes 8 hours to cross the solar system's diameter. This computer would be slower than your laptop for many operations!

**Quantum Computer Reality:**
Even quantum computers can "only" provide sqrt(n) speedup for searching (Grover's algorithm). For 256-bit keys, this means 2^128 operations instead of 2^256. That's still 10^38 operations - requiring universe-scale quantum computers running for billions of years.

**Time Crystal Computation:**
Even if we could build computers from hypothetical time crystals (perpetual motion at quantum level), we'd still be limited by the speed of information propagation. The universe has a maximum computational capacity regardless of technology.

**Everyday Objects with Cosmic Complexity:**

**Your Music Library:**
The number of possible playlists from just 100 songs is 100! ≈ 10^157. You could listen to a different ordering every second since the Big Bang and not scratch the surface.

**A Rubik's Cube:**
43 quintillion positions (4.3 × 10^19). If you turned it once per second, it would take 1.4 trillion years to see all states - 100 times the age of the universe.

**Scrabble Games:**
The number of possible Scrabble games is estimated at 10^800. The number of legal board positions alone exceeds 10^150.

**Your Browser History:**
The sequence of websites you've visited in order is almost certainly unique in human history. With just 1000 sites to choose from, visiting 30 sites creates 1000^30 ≈ 10^90 possible histories.

**The "Information Apocalypse" Scenarios:**

**The Library of Babel (Digital Edition):**
Borges imagined a library containing all possible 410-page books. A digital version with all possible 1MB text files would contain every truth and every lie, every accurate prediction and every false prophecy, making truth indistinguishable from fiction.

**The Screenshot Paradox:**
All possible 1920×1080 screenshots already "exist" mathematically (256^(1920×1080×3) possibilities). Among them are:
- Screenshots of every moment of every possible movie
- Every possible photo of you from every angle
- Tomorrow's news headlines
- Screenshots of stocks prices from the year 3000

**The Minecraft Reality:**
A Minecraft world can be 60 million × 60 million blocks, each with multiple possible states. The number of possible Minecraft worlds (roughly 10^10^33) exceeds not just atoms in the universe, but the number of possible universes in most multiverse theories!

**Philosophical Implications:**

**The "Already Exists" Problem:**
In the space of all possible 1TB hard drives, there exists:
- A perfect simulation of your entire life
- The true theory of everything
- A message from alien civilizations
- Every possible future history of humanity

They're all "there" in the mathematical space - we just can't find them without checking 2^(8 trillion) possibilities.

**The Entropy Death of Meaning:**
As storage increases, the ratio of "meaningful" to "possible" data approaches zero. In the space of all possible 4K videos, 99.99999...% are pure static. Finding meaning becomes harder than finding a specific atom in infinite universes.

**The Computational Theology:**
If computing all possible 256-bit numbers requires more energy than exists in the universe, does this mean some numbers are literally "unthinkable" by any physical process? Are there thoughts that physics forbids?

These numbers suggest we live in a thin slice of reality - the computable, the reachable, the thinkable - surrounded by an infinite ocean of mathematical possibilities that will never be realized in any physical universe!
